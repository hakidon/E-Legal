A client from a respectable law firm is facing problems with inefficiencies in time and staff management during case proceedings. The increasing caseloads necessitates a centralized solution for streamlined case management. The absence of a comprehensive system has resulted in missed deadlines and a lack of real-time insights into case statuses for the firm. To address these challenges, we introduce the e-Legal web application; a solution for legal case management system. It is a user-friendly application that facilitates efficient task assignment, enables comprehensive case monitoring, ensures real-time updates on case statuses, and incorporates notification systems for critical dates associated to individual cases. The project aims to establish a cohesive and integrated solution with the goal of empowering the firm with tools needed for a more efficient, responsive, and streamlined approach to legal case management.
